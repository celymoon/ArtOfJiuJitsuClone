# Art Of JiuJitsu Website Clone
<h2>This is just another example of what I can do in 2 days only using pure HTML & CSS.</h2>

<h3>I cloned one of the pages of Art of Jiu Jitsu's website to show you what I can do in a time of 32hr00.<br> Later I'll turn this project responsive as well but right now this isn't my priority. I used a 1903x1560 screen for this project. </h3>

<h3>The original Website: <a href="https://artofjiujitsu.com/" target="_blank">https://artofjiujitsu.com/</a></h3>

<h5>Hope you enjoy this small project. :) </h5>
